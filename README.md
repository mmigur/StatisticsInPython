2. DataVisualize
    * In this file, I worked with basic visualizations and learned how to correctly apply and design them

    * In this file, I got acquainted with the Monte Carlo simulation method, and applied the simulation based on the 777 slot machine.
  
4. CorrAndRegression
    * In this file, I learned the basic ways to evaluate correlation and even built the first machine learning model (linear regression), and also touched on residual analysis a little.

5. ClustersAndKMeans
